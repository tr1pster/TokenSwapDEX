TokenSwapDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) implemented as a Solidity smart contract, designed for seamless token swapping and liquidity provision. It enables users to exchange tokens at predefined rates or according to liquidity pool ratios, contribute to the liquidity pool, and withdraw their share with proportionate returns. The smart contract includes mechanisms for handling transaction fees, which are reinvested into the pool, thus enhancing its value. Features include detailed functions for balance inquiries, swap calculations, and total liquidity tracking, catering to a transparent and efficient DeFi experience.
